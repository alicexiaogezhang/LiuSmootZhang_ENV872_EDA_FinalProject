# <LiuSmootZhang_ENV872_EDA_FinalProject>


## Summary

<This is the repository for ENV872 final project by Abby Liu, Jacob Smoot, Xiaoge Zhang. In this project, we delve into the following questions: How do economic indicators, such as energy prices, GDP, and oil production, influence renewable energy adoption in different regions of the US?
What role do demographic variables, such as IQ and political affiliation, play in shaping attitudes towards renewable energy and driving adoption? In rstudio, we performed data scraping, data cleaning and wrangling, exploratory analysis, and statistical analysis. >
